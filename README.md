# Crypto wallet

## Introduction
The goal of this wallet is to have a single wallet login that can work with any chain, be it EVM compatible or not. 

This project is powered using vite. The front-end is made using React + Typescript and the backend using Express.js and MongoDB. 


## How to run?

Here are the steps to run the front-end of the website:
1. Navigate to crypto-wallet vite project folder - `cd crypto-wallet`
2. Install the node_modules - `npm i`
3. Start the server - `npm run dev`

## TODOs
